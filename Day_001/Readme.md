DAY 001 – Basic Logic Gates
Dataflow vs Structural Modeling

This is where it all begins.

I implemented the fundamental logic gates — AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR — using both dataflow and structural modeling in Verilog.

Simulated everything using Icarus Verilog, and explored waveforms through GTKWave.

Files Included
basic_gates_dataflow.v – Logic gates using dataflow style

basic_gates_structural.v – Logic gates using structural style

basic_gates_tb.v – Unified testbench to verify all gates

basic_gates.vcd – VCD waveform output file

gates.out – Compiled simulation output

What I Explored
How the same logic can be described structurally and dataflow-wise

The importance of modeling styles in synthesis and readability

Running Verilog simulations on the terminal

Tracing waveforms on GTKWave

Pushing it all to GitHub the right way, inside a dedicated folder

Not just logic gates.
This is me, starting something that matters.
